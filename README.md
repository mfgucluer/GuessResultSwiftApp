# GuessResultSwiftApp




This swift app is a game for guessing multiplication. After the dice are rolled, you have as many rights as the number on the dice to predict the result that will be obtained by multiplying the random numbers given to you. For example, if you roll the dice and a 5 is rolled, you have 5 chances to guess the multiplication correctly and you must write the correct result without guessing more than 5 to win the Game.
